              That's why I decided to pursue a career in web development, so I could play a part in making the web a 
              more beautiful and helpful place. My expertise lies in React, Tailwind, SCSS, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
              and I am always striving to improve my skills and keep up with the latest trends in web development. 
              I am a quick learner and a problem solver, and I love taking on new challenges and finding creative
