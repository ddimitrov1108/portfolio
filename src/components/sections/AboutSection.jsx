              Hello! My name is Daniel and I enjoy bringing ideas to life by
              creating web apps. I started my adventure in programming when I
              was in high school with basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and
              JavaScript. I loved building basic applications with them so I
              went digging deeper into the world of web development.
            </p>

            <p>
              I'm a Compute Science student at Technical University of Varna and
              I'm currently in my 4th year.
            </p>

            <div>
              <p className="font-semibold">
                Here are a few technologies Iâ€™ve been working with recently:
              </p>
              <div className="grid grid-cols-2 mt-4">
                {techStack.map((tech, index) => (
                  <p
                    key={index}
                    className="w-fit col-span-1 flex items-center justify-center gap-2"
                  >
                    <FaCaretRight className="text-sm text-primary-main" />
                    <span>{tech}</span>
                  </p>
                ))}
