              Hello! My name is Daniel and I enjoy bringing ideas to life by
              creating web apps. I started my adventure in programming when I
              was in high school with basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and
              JavaScript. I loved building basic applications with them so I
              went digging deeper into the world of web development.
            </p>

            <p>
              I'm a Compute Science student at Technical University of Varna and
              I'm currently in my 4th year. Also I'm ambitious and motivated. I
              can work alone or in a team. I accept criticism and advice from
              more experienced colleagues in the environment in which I will be
              placed. I'm ready for opportunities and challenges in an
              environment where innovation, education, and work are valued and
              encouraged.
            </p>

                Here are a few technologies Iâ€™ve been working with recently:

              <div className="grid grid-cols-2 mt-4">
                {techStack.map((tech, index) => (

                    className="w-fit col-span-1 flex items-center justify-center gap-2"
                  >
                    <FaCaretRight className="text-sm text-primary-main" />
