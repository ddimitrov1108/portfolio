            I started my adventure in programming when I was in high school with
            basic knowledge in HTML,CSS and JavaScript. I loved building with
            them so I started digging deeper in the Web Development world.
            Learned how to create apps using Bootstrap/JQuery and moved on to
            some Back-end basics with Node.js.

            I am ambitious and motivated. I can work alone or in a team. I
            accept criticism and advice from more experienced colleagues in the
            environment where I will be placed. I am ready for opportunities and
            challenges in an environment where innovation, education, and work
            are valued and encouraged.
