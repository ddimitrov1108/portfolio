              Hello! My name is Daniel and I enjoy bringing ideas to life by
              creating web apps. I started my adventure in programming when I
              was in high school with basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and
              JavaScript. I loved building basic applications with them so I
              went digging deeper into the Web Development world.
            </p>

              im currently in my 4th year.
